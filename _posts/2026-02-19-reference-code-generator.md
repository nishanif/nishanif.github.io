Creating consistent reference codes manually can be repetitive and error-prone, especially when you are preparing large lists for HR reporting, payroll imports, or system configuration updates.

The **Reference Code Generator** is designed to make that process fast and repeatable.

## What the tool can do

- Convert text using case patterns (upper, lower, sentence, title, toggle case)
- Replace spaces with standard symbols or a custom character
- Add optional text at the start/end of each line or before/after a selected character position
- Optionally set a target character length per output line
- Show output length metrics (single line length, or min/max for multi-line output)
- Export generated results as a CSV file

## Why this helps

When reference codes follow a consistent pattern, downstream processes are easier to manage:

- Fewer data-entry mistakes
- Cleaner uploads into HRIS and reporting tools
- Better readability for audit and validation
- Faster bulk preparation work
