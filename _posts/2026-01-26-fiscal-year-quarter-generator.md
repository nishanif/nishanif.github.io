Here is a short walkthrough of the first tool on this site and how it helps HR teams stay aligned on fiscal reporting cycles.

## Why it helps

Many teams track projects by fiscal year and quarter. This lightweight generator removes the guesswork and provides a quick answer for any date you pick.

## Try the tool

Note: This tool follows the Australian fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), so Q1 begins in July.
